Game made in godot
Basically the idea was that there would be 3 different sections for arcade, gambling and a shop
Arcade would be low risk and low reward, gambing would be high risk and high reward and the shop you could buy something,
Took way too much time so i just added two arcade games.
The machines in the front are buttons which creates a popup to play a game.
I found the bg online, popup art and music was given by a friend.
